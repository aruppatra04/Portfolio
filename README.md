## Dependencies

This project leverages a range of powerful tools and libraries to deliver its functionality and user experience. Some of the core dependencies include (but are not limited to; a complete list can be found in `package.json`):

* **React:** A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It enables the creation of interactive and dynamic web applications.
* **Vite:** A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development environment and efficient build process for modern web projects like React applications.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid styling by applying small, single-purpose utility classes directly in the HTML. Its configuration is managed by `tailwind.config.js`.
* **ESLint:** A widely used static code analysis tool for JavaScript and JSX. It helps maintain code quality and consistency by identifying and reporting on problematic patterns. Its behavior is defined in `eslint.config.js`.
* **PostCSS:** A powerful tool for transforming CSS using JavaScript plugins. It's often used for tasks such as automatically adding vendor prefixes, using future CSS syntax, and optimizing CSS. Its configuration is in `postcss.config.js`.

For a comprehensive list of all dependencies and their specific versions, please refer to the `package.json` file located in the project's root directory.

## Installation

To set up a local development environment and run this portfolio website on your machine, follow these straightforward steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Begin by cloning the project repository from its source (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
    *(Make sure to replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your project's repository.)*

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project's root directory using your terminal or command prompt:
    ```bash
    cd my-portfolio
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    The project relies on various external libraries and tools, which are managed by npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn. Choose one of the following commands to install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `package.json` file:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This process might take a few minutes depending on your internet connection and system speed.

## Running the Project

After successfully installing the dependencies, you can start the development server to view and interact with the portfolio website in your local browser. Use one of the following commands based on your package manager:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Executing this command will typically initiate a development server powered by Vite. You should see output in your terminal indicating the server's address, usually something like `http://localhost:5173/`. The website should automatically open in your default web browser. During development, Vite provides features like hot module replacement (HMR), which allows you to see changes in your code reflected in the browser almost instantly without a full page reload.

## Building for Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your portfolio website to a hosting provider, you'll need to create an optimized production build. Use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
```
This command will trigger Vite to build your React application, performing optimizations such as code minification, bundling, and asset optimization. The resulting static files will be generated in a `dist` directory at the root of your project. You can then deploy the contents of this `dist` folder to your chosen hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting).
